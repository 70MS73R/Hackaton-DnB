          <h2>Drum'n Bass</h2>

          <p>
            Drum and bass (also written as drum & bass or drum 'n' bass and
            commonly abbreviated as D&B, DnB, or D'n'B) is a genre of electronic
            dance music characterized by fast breakbeats (typically 165-185
            beats per minute) with heavy bass and sub-bass lines, samples, and
            synthesizers. The genre grew out of the UK's jungle scene in the
            early 1990s. The popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak
            ran parallel to several other UK dance styles. A major influence was
            the original Jamaican dub and reggae sound that influenced jungle's
            bass-heavy sound. Another feature of the style is the complex
            syncopation of the drum tracks' breakbeat. Drum and bass subgenres
            include breakcore, ragga jungle, hardstep, darkstep, techstep,
            neurofunk, ambient drum and bass, liquid funk (a.k.a. liquid drum
            and bass), jump up, drumfunk, sambass, and drill 'n' bass. Drum and
            bass has influenced many other genres like hip hop, big beat,
            dubstep, house, trip hop, ambient music, techno, jazz, rock and pop.
            Drum and bass is dominated by a relatively small group of record
            labels. Major international music labels had shown very little
            interest in the drum and bass scene until BMG Rights Management
            acquired RAM in February 2016. Since then, the genre has seen a
            significant growth in exposure. Whilst the origin of drum and bass
            music is in the UK, the genre has evolved considerably with many
            other prominent fanbases located in all over the world.
